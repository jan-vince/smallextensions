# Small Extensions
> Set of very simple extensions for [OctoberCMS](http://www.octobercms.com) and it's plugins.

OctoberCMS is great system, but we all have a little bit different needs. So I have started this.


## Installation

**GitHub** clone into `/plugins` dir:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jan-vince/smallextensions
```

**OctoberCMS plugins page**
> Will be posted soon


## Extensions

### Rainlab.Blog Extension

*OctoberCMS > Backend > Settings > Small Extensions > Blog*

> *Depends on: [Rainlab.Blog](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-blog) plugin!*


This is a great plugin, but none of my clients is happy with MarkDown syntax to edit posts.

So the the very first extension is about replacing default MD editor with built in Richtext editor.


#### Settings

* **Enable WYSIWYG editor**

	* Switch between default MarkDown or OctoberCMS's Rich editor.
	* If on, WYSIWIG editor is used for blog post editing.
